# Guess the Number -- Binary Exploitation

I think it's pretty nice that they've given us the code here. But before we even look at the code, let's run the binary and give that a shot. Running
```
./guess_num
``` 
gives us this:
```
Welcome to the number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number. Can you guess it?
Guess right and you get a shell!
Enter your number: 9384 
You entered 9384. Let's see if it was right...
```

I just tried a random number, and obviously 9384 wasn't right. Oh well, let's now dive into the code. 

After opening up `guess_num.c` there are a couple interesting things to note here. Let's go through them one by one. What we're trying to do is get a high level idea of what the program is doing.

First we note the conspicuous `win` function, which seems to give us a shell, indicated by
```c
system("/bin/sh -i");
```
