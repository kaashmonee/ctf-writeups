# Guess the Number -- Binary Exploitation

I think it's pretty nice that they've given us the code here. But before we even look at the code, let's run the binary and give that a shot. Running
```
./guess_num
``` 
gives us this:
```
Welcome to the number guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number. Can you guess it?
Guess right and you get a shell!
Enter your number: 9384 
You entered 9384. Let's see if it was right...
```

I just tried a random number, and obviously 9384 wasn't right. Oh well, let's now dive into the code. 

After opening up `guess_num.c` there are a couple interesting things to note here. Let's go through them one by one. What we're trying to do is get a high level idea of what the program is doing.

First we note the conspicuous `win` function, which seems to give us a shell, indicated by
```c
system("/bin/sh -i");
```

So it seems like, somehow, if we could call that function, we'd have what we were looking for.

Hmm...let's keep going.

We then get the print statements, so nothing *too* interesting going on over there. 

We see a `scanf`, which, if we check the man pages by going `man scanf`, which basically says, "Get the first 32 characters of what the user types in."

Then we see something a little more interesting:
```c
val = strtol(buf, NULL, 10);
```
Once again, going back to the man pages, we see that this converts `buf` to a `long int`.

Finally, we see that
```c
val >>= 4;
// That's the same thing as: val = val >> 4. 
```
That means that the value is being right shifted by 4.

Still, that is fine. We are still not 100% sure what we have to do...right?

Let's move onto the next line:
```c
((void (*)(void))val)();
```
Now what in the world is going on here? All this function does is run anything you give it. 
Here's a great link on how to read such `C` declarations. It's called the *Clockwise/Spiral Rule*.
